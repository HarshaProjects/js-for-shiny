We will spend most of our time in this workshop in RStudio and a web browser. [RStudio Desktop][rstudio-desktop] is preferred because we will occasionally need to run commands like `npm` in your computer's terminal or console.

I recommend the [Firefox], [Firefox Developer Edition][firefox-dev], or [Chrome] browsers and will use Firefox during the workshop.

:woman_technologist: Please follow the instructions in each section of the sidebar to get setup.
